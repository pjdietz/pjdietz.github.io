Hi! I'm PJ. I like to build stuff.

I spend most of my time in PHP-land, but I also do a bit of Node.js and Android and iOS app development.

I'm a senior developer at [American Reading Company](https://www.americanreading.com) where I work on [Bookshelf](https://www.arcbookshelf.com), our e-reader platform, and [SchoolPace](https://www.schoolpace.com), our student performance management system.

My pet project is [WellRESTed](http://www.wellrested.org), a PHP library for building RESTful APIs and websites based on [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).

Aside from being a developer, I'm also a husband, cat wrangler, dog daddy, skeptic, science enthusiast, jazz aficionado, WoW healer, and freelance astronaut.

Carl Sagan wrote in *[The Demon-Haunted World](https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469)*, “Not explaining science seems to me perverse. When you’re in love, you want to tell the world.” This is the way I see programming, and I’ve put this site together to have a place to share tips and code snippets, plugins and projects.

Happy coding!
